<h1>2003page has been shutdown since May 8th 2020.</h1>
<h1>Project Pheonix has been shutdown since July 15th 2020.</h1>
<p>Alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://retrosite.ga/">Retrosite.ga</a>, a site created in Janaury 2020 by two former 2003page contributors after a terrible 2003page redesign caused by me.</li>
<li><a href="https://forkiesassds.github.io/twtacct/">TWTACCT</a>, a website created just days before 2003page's shutdown by a former 2003page contributor. While this doesn't use the "classic aesthetic" that 2003page and Retrosite uses. It is a more modern version.</li>
<li><a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a>, this works differently from the other 3, but is far, far more better than 2003page/Project 
Pheonix.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>That's all, folks.</em></p>
